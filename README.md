# Python Scripts

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of **Python scripts** demonstrating my understanding of core Python programming concepts. The code is organized topic-wise to reflect a clear and systematic approach to learning and applying the language.

The focus of this repository is **clarity, correctness, and fundamentals**, rather than large applications.

---

## Repository Structure

The scripts are grouped by topic for easier navigation:

```text
01_basics           → Variables, data types, input/output, operators
02_fundamentals     → Control flow, loops, functions, pattern logic
03_data_structures  → Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, searching
04_oops             → Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism
05_file_handling    → File I/O, exceptions, JSON handling
```

Each directory contains small, focused scripts addressing a specific concept.

---

## Topics Covered

* Core Python syntax and execution model
* Conditional statements and looping constructs
* Functions and lambda expressions
* Built-in data structures and basic algorithms
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* File handling, exception handling, and JSON processing

---

## Usage

Python 3.x is required.

```bash
python <script_name>.py
```

Example:

```bash
python 01_basics/hello_world.py
```

---

## Scope

This repository is intended to demonstrate **Python fundamentals and coding discipline**.
More advanced, project-oriented work (data analysis, automation, machine learning) is maintained in separate repositories.
